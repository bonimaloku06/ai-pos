# ✅ Sales Reports Fixed!

## Problem
Sales made in POS weren't showing up in the reports, even though they were saved to the database.

## Root Cause
**Date Range Bug:** The reports API was using `new Date(endDate)` which sets the time to **00:00:00** (midnight). This meant:
- Query: `WHERE created_at <= '2025-10-06 00:00:00'`
- Your sales: Created at `09:17:41` and `09:13:58`
- Result: Sales excluded because they happened AFTER midnight! ❌

## Fix Applied
**File:** `apps/api-core/src/routes/reports.ts`

Changed the endDate to include the **entire day** (up to 23:59:59.999):

```typescript
// BEFORE (wrong)
if (endDate) where.createdAt.lte = new Date(endDate);

// AFTER (correct)
if (endDate) {
  // End of day (23:59:59.999)
  const endOfDay = new Date(endDate);
  endOfDay.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  where.createdAt.lte = endOfDay;
}
```

This fix was applied to **all report types**:
- Sales report
- Margins report

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "totalSales": 0,
  "totalTransactions": 0
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "totalSales": 12.48,
  "totalTransactions": 2
}
```

## How to Verify

1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:5173/reports
2. **Select "Today"** date range
3. **You should now see:**
   - Total sales: $12.48
   - Transactions: 2
   - Top products with sales data

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Sales Report** - Shows today's sales  
✅ **Date Range Filtering** - "Today" button works correctly  
✅ **Custom Date Ranges** - End date now includes full day  
✅ **Top Products** - Displays correctly  
✅ **Time Series** - Daily breakdown works  

## Technical Details

### The Issue
JavaScript `new Date("2025-10-06")` creates:
```
2025-10-06T00:00:00.000Z  // Midnight at start of day
```

But sales are created with current time:
```
2025-10-06T09:17:41.388Z  // 9:17 AM
```

Query `WHERE created_at <= '2025-10-06T00:00:00'` excludes 9:17 AM!

### The Solution
Set end date to end-of-day:
```
2025-10-06T23:59:59.999Z  // 11:59 PM
```

Now query includes ALL sales during the day! ✅

- `apps/api-core/src/routes/reports.ts` (Lines 19-20, 134-135)

## Auto-Reload

The API Core is running with `tsx` in watch mode, so it automatically reloaded with the fix. No restart needed!

## All Issues Now Resolved

1. ✅ Product search in POS - WORKING
2. ✅ Meilisearch sync - WORKING
3. ✅ Sales reports - WORKING
4. ✅ Date range filtering - WORKING

**Everything is now fully functional!** 🎉

## Example Response

After fix, calling:
```
GET /api/reports/sales?startDate=2025-10-06&endDate=2025-10-06
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalSales": 12.48,
    "totalTransactions": 2,
    "totalTax": 0.99,
    "totalDiscount": 0,
    "avgTransaction": 6.24
  },
  "timeSeries": [
    {
      "period": "2025-10-06",
      "sales": 12.48,
      "transactions": 2
    }
  ],
  "topProducts": [
    {
      "productId": "...",
      "name": "Paracetamol 500mg",
      "qty": 2,
      "revenue": 7.80
    },
    {
      "productId": "...",
      "name": "Ibuprofen 200mg",
      "qty": 1,
      "revenue": 4.68
    }
  ]
}
```

Perfect! ✅
