- ✅ **Cost Calculations**
  - Total cost per scenario
  - Cost per day
  - Supplier price comparison
  
- ✅ **Smart Recommendations**
  - Pattern-based suggestions
  - STEADY → 2-4 weeks
  - GROWING → 4-6 weeks
  - DECLINING → 1-2 weeks
  - SEASONAL → 4-8 weeks
  - ERRATIC → 1-2 weeks

**Test Results:**
```
Current Stock: 50 units
Daily Demand: 8 units
Status: LOW (6.25 days remaining)

Scenarios:
  1 Week:  Order 18 units → €180 → Lasts 8.5 days
  1 Month: Order 238 units → €2,380 → Lasts 36 days

Supplier Comparison (1 Week):
  Santefarm: €153.00 ✓ BEST PRICE (saves €27)
  Asgeto:    €180.00
```

## How They Work Together

### Example: "Atoris 20mg" Order Recommendation

**Step 1: Forecast Engine Analyzes Sales**
```python
Sales history: [8, 10, 7, 12, 9, 8, 11, ...]
Pattern: STEADY
Trend: Slight growth (+5%)
Day-of-week: Higher on Mon-Tue
Forecast: 8.5 units/day (next 7 days)
Confidence: 85%
```

**Step 2: Coverage Calculator Generates Scenarios**
```python
Current stock: 50 units
Days remaining: 5.9 days

Scenarios:
  1 Day:  Order 0 units  (sufficient)
  1 Week: Order 21 units (€210)
  1 Month: Order 245 units (€2,450)
```

**Step 3: Supplier Engine Finds Best Option**
```python
Today: Friday

Option 1 - Asgeto:
  - Order: Today (Friday)
  - Delivery: Sunday (2 days)
  - Cost: €210 (@ €10/unit)
  - Risk: LOW

Option 2 - Santefarm:
  - Order: Monday (3 days wait)
  - Delivery: Thursday (6 days)
  - Cost: €178.50 (@ €8.50/unit) ✓ SAVES €31.50
  - Risk: NONE (stock lasts 5.9 days)

Recommendation: WAIT UNTIL MONDAY → Order from Santefarm
Reason: "Stock adequate; Save 15% by waiting 3 days"
```
