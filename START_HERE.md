# ✅ PORT CONFLICT FIXED - START HERE

## 🎉 All Done! Your Docker services are already running!

The port conflict issue has been **completely resolved**. All services are now using high port numbers (10000+) that won't conflict with your other projects.

## 🚀 Quick Commands

### Start Services (if not already running)

```bash
./infra/docker/start.sh
```

### Start the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Access Your Application

- **Web App**: http://localhost:15174
- **API**: http://localhost:14000

### Stop Services

```bash
./infra/docker/stop.sh
```

## 📊 New Ports (10000+ Range)

Your services now use these ports:

| Service    | Port  | URL                    |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Web App    | 15174 | http://localhost:15174 |
| API        | 14000 | http://localhost:14000 |
| Database   | 15433 | localhost:15433        |
| Redis      | 16380 | localhost:16380        |
| Search     | 17701 | http://localhost:17701 |
| Storage UI | 19101 | http://localhost:19101 |
| Grafana    | 13002 | http://localhost:13002 |
| MailHog    | 18026 | http://localhost:18026 |
