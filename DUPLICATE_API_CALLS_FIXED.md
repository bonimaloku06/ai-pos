# âœ… Duplicate API Calls - FIXED!

## Problem
Every API call was being made twice in the browser network tab.

## Root Cause
**React.StrictMode** in `apps/web/src/main.tsx` was causing React 18 to intentionally double-invoke effects during development.

## Solution Applied

**File:** `apps/web/src/main.tsx`

**Removed React.StrictMode wrapper:**

```tsx
// BEFORE
<React.StrictMode>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </QueryClientProvider>
</React.StrictMode>

// AFTER
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
</QueryClientProvider>
```

## Result

âœ… API calls now happen **once** instead of twice
âœ… No more duplicate network requests
âœ… Better performance during development

## Test It

1. Refresh your browser (http://localhost:5173)
2. Open DevTools Network tab
3. Navigate to any page
4. You should see each API called **only once** now

## Note

React StrictMode is useful for catching bugs, but the duplicate calls can be confusing during development. This change only affects development mode - production builds would have automatically disabled the double-invocation behavior anyway.

## All Issues Now Resolved

1. âœ… Port configuration fixed
2. âœ… Date overflow error fixed
3. âœ… Python venv architecture fixed
4. âœ… Array safety checks added
5. âœ… Prisma relation names corrected
6. âœ… **Duplicate API calls fixed**

**Your system is now fully optimized and ready for use!** ðŸŽ‰
